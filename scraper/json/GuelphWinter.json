There will be a specific emphasis on wildlife rehabilitation: its benefits, risks (to humans and animals), ethical concerns, principles of stabilization of sick and injured animals, and other key areas for consideration. Common presentations and underlying reasons for sick and injured animals that are admitted to a rehabilitation centre are presented. Whether in a wildlife centre or in the field, understanding important physiologic differences between species and how to stabilize animals for subsequent treatment by a permitted rehabilitator or a wildlife veterinarian are discussed.",

What are the roles of reason and emotion in ethics? Is morality grounded on a principle, and if so, what is it? Are there any traits of character that one must have to be a good person?

Students will be able to familiarize themselves with the techniques and equipment involved in various branches of marine biology and oceanography. In addition to regular tuition fees, students are responsible for the cost of transportation to St. Andrews, and for charges levied by the Huntsman Marine Science Centre for room and board. These fees are paid to Student Finance and Awards of the University of Guelph. A department application form must be submitted for approval before course selection. The signature of the course coordinator is required to select the course. This course must be recorded as part of your Fall course selection and tuition and compulsory fees will be calculated accordingly.
